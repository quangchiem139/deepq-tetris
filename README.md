# DeepQ TETRIS - a 2 day hackathon project

## Goal
Creating a Tetris AI with Reinforcement Learning!

## Start
Watching videos about Reinforcement Learning :)

https://deeplizard.com/learn/video/nyjbcRQ-uQ8

## Dependencies

- [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/) for neural net
- [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) for sound
- [pynput](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/) for keyboard listeners


## Usage

You can either play the game yourself, or train the AI by letting it play.

To train the AI call:
`python train.py`

Or play the game yourself to set a new highscore!
`python run.py`


## Features

- 7 unique Tetromino shapes
- best music
- highscore lists
- watch the AI play
- plotting of results (soon)
